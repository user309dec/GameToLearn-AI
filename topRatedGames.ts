    description: "Test your listening skills! Match the spoken Japanese Hiragana sound to the correct character. A fun way to train your ear for a new language.",
    educationalGuide: `<h3>The Japanese Syllabary: Hiragana</h3>
<p>Unlike English which uses an alphabet (where letters represent consonants and vowels), Japanese uses a syllabary called <strong>Hiragana (ひらがな)</strong>. Each character represents a whole syllable (a mora).</p>
<h4>Key Concepts:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mora:</strong> A unit of sound that determines timing in the language. Most Hiragana characters represent one mora (e.g., 'か' (ka), 'し' (shi)).</li>
    <li><strong>Phonetic System:</strong> Hiragana is purely phonetic. Once you learn the sound for each character, you can pronounce any word written in it. This game trains your ear to recognize those distinct sounds.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Hiragana is used for native Japanese words, grammatical particles (like 'は' (wa) and 'を' (o)), and verb/adjective endings. It's the first writing system Japanese children learn.</li>
</ul>`,
    data: {
      spec: `An interactive 2D RPG-style game called "Kana Sounds Match" designed to help players learn Japanese Hiragana pronunciation.

SPECIFICATIONS:
1. The game is styled to resemble a training dojo.
2. The game features a real-time score and lives tracker.
3. In each round, the player hears the pronunciation of a Hiragana character, generated using the Web Speech API.
4. Four stone tablets, each with a different Hiragana character, are displayed. One is the correct match for the sound.
5. The player clicks a tablet to make their choice.
6. A correct match awards points and starts a new round.
7. An incorrect match costs one life. The game ends when the player runs out of lives.
8. The game includes a start screen with instructions and a game over screen with the final score and an option to play again.`,

    educationalGuide: `<h3>The Periodic Table: A Chemical Codex</h3>
<p>This game challenges your knowledge of the fundamental building blocks of matter: the elements.</p>
<h4>Key Concepts:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Element Symbol:</strong> A one or two-letter abbreviation for a chemical element (e.g., 'Au' for Gold, 'O' for Oxygen). These are universal in chemistry.</li>
    <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> The number of protons in an atom's nucleus. This number is unique to each element and defines it. For example, any atom with 6 protons is Carbon.</li>
    <li><strong>The Periodic Table:</strong> An organized chart of all known elements. It's arranged by increasing atomic number and recurring chemical properties, allowing scientists to predict an element's behavior.</li>
</ul>`,
    data: {
      spec: `A 2D RPG-styled memory game called "Element Matching Quest" designed to help players learn element symbols and their properties.

SPECIFICATIONS:
1.  The game board is styled to resemble an alchemist's workshop table.
2.  The game features a 60-second timer and a real-time score tracker.
3.  A grid of "elemental rune" cards is displayed face down. Each card with an element's symbol (e.g., 'Na') has a corresponding card with one of its properties (e.g., 'Atomic #: 11' or its name 'Sodium').
4.  Players click any two cards to flip them face up.
5.  If the two cards form a matching pair, they remain face up, and the player earns points.
6.  If the cards are not a match, they automatically flip back face down after a brief delay, and a small time penalty is deducted from the timer.
7.  The objective is to find all the matching pairs as quickly as possible to achieve the highest score before the timer runs out.
8.  The game includes a start screen with instructions and an end screen displaying the final score with an option to play again.`,

    educationalGuide: `<h3>Orbital Mechanics 101</h3>
<p>This game is a simulation of Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which governs the motion of planets and satellites.</p>
<h4>Key Formula:</h4>
<p>The force of gravity (F) between two objects is:</p>
<code>F = G * (m1 * m2) / r²</code>
<ul>
    <li><strong>G:</strong> The gravitational constant.</li>
    <li><strong>m1, m2:</strong> The masses of the two objects.</li>
    <li><strong>r:</strong> The distance between the centers of the objects.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Core Concepts:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Gravity Assist (Slingshot):</strong> By flying close to a large planet, a satellite can use the planet's gravity to accelerate and change direction. It's like "stealing" a tiny bit of the planet's massive orbital energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Trajectory:</strong> The path an object follows through space under the influence of gravity. In this game, your initial launch vector (speed and direction) determines the entire trajectory. Small changes can lead to vastly different outcomes!</li>
</ul>`,
    data: {
      spec: `An interactive 2D physics game where players learn about gravity and orbital mechanics.

SPECIFICATIONS:
1. The game presents a top-down view of a space environment containing a launcher, planets, and a target destination.
2. The player must launch a satellite from the launcher to the target.
3. The launch mechanic is a "slingshot" style control: the user clicks and drags from the launcher to set the direction and velocity of the satellite.
4. While aiming, a predictive trajectory line shows the satellite's potential path, taking into account the gravitational pull of the planets.
5. Once launched, the satellite's movement is simulated based on the gravitational forces exerted by the planets.
6. A successful level is completed when the satellite reaches the target. Crashing into a planet or flying off-screen results in a failed attempt.
7. The game consists of multiple levels with increasingly complex arrangements of planets, requiring different slingshot maneuvers.
8. The UI displays the current level and the number of attempts for that level.`,

    description: "Take a risk, reap the reward! Battle monsters with varying hit probabilities. This game teaches the fundamentals of expected value and risk assessment in a classic RPG format.",
    educationalGuide: `<h3>Probability & Expected Value</h3>
<p>Every attack in this game is a calculated risk. The key to a high score is understanding which risks are worth taking using the concept of <strong>Expected Value (EV)</strong>.</p>
<h4>Key Concepts:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Probability (P):</strong> The likelihood of an event occurring. In this game, it's the "Hit Chance". A 90% chance means there are 90 desired outcomes out of 100 total possibilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Value (EV):</strong> A predicted value for an investment (or in this case, an attack) over the long run. It helps you decide if a choice is profitable on average.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Calculation:</h4>
<p>For the <strong>Goblin</strong> (60% Hit, +30 Score, -15 HP):</p>
<code>EV = (P(Win) * Reward) - (P(Loss) * Cost)</code>
<code>EV = (0.60 * 30) - (0.40 * 15)</code>
<code>EV = 18 - 6 = +12</code>
<p>On average, attacking a Goblin yields a positive return of 12 points. Compare this to other monsters to make the best strategic choice!</p>`,
    data: {
      spec: `A 2D RPG-styled game where players battle monsters to learn about probability and risk management. Defeat monsters with varying hit probabilities to earn points, but be careful—a miss will cost you health!

SPECIFICATIONS:
1.  The game screen displays a dungeon floor, a player character sprite, a score display, and a health bar.
2.  The game starts with the player at 100 Health Points (HP).
3.  Monsters spawn randomly on the screen. Each monster displays its name, a "Hit Chance" percentage, and the score reward for defeating it.
4.  Players click on a monster to attack. A random outcome is generated based on the monster's "Hit Chance."
5.  A successful hit defeats the monster, awards the player points, and removes the monster from the screen. A new monster spawns after a short delay. Higher-risk monsters (lower hit chance) award more points.
6.  A missed attack results in the player losing HP. The monster remains on screen. More dangerous monsters deal more damage.
7.  The game ends when the player's HP reaches 0.
8.  A final score screen is displayed, with an option to play again.
9.  The goal is to achieve the highest possible score before running out of health.`,

<ul>
    <li><strong>Nucleus:</strong> The "command center" that contains the cell's genetic material (DNA). It controls all cell activities.</li>
